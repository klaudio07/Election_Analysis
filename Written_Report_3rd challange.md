### Election-Audit Summary:

**Below are two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections**.

1. Including voters age:

Age is one of the leading indicators of voter turnaround. We can do this by adding the age description in coding lines following the data we already have, example:

winning_county = ""

winning_county_count = 0

winning_county_percentage = 0

*adding*

winning_county_age = 0

in other similar lines too.

2. Including voters enthusiasm:

It is more a quality indicator. Similarly to the above coding lines we could add  (Extremely motivated

Very motivated

Somewhat motivated

Not too motivated

Not at all motivated

No opinion)
